libatl
Provides additional templates and function helpers for Microsoft Active Template Library

Building
- .h files can be used individually. However, we do encourage you to include the entire library project and reference it in dependant projects of your solution, as libatl might develop some non-inline code over time.
- libatl.vcxproj requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1 and ..\..\include folder with common.props, Debug.props, Release.props, Win32.props, and x64.props files to customize building process for individual applications.

Documentation
None yet. Please see the .h files.
